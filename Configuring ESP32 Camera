//Install Arduino IDE and ESP32 Camera add on. 

/*
To upload code to the ESP32-CAM using Arduino IDE, follow the next steps:

Go to Tools > Board and select AI-Thinker ESP32-CAM. You must have the ESP32 add-on installed. Otherwise, this board wonâ€™t show up on the Boards menu.

Go to Tools > Port and select the COM port the ESP32-CAM is connected to.

For demonstration purposes, you can upload a blank sketch to your board:
void setup() {
  // put your setup code here, to run once:
}

void loop() {
  // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:
}
*/
//Then upload on Arduino IDE
//Dots on the debugging window >> press the ESP32-CAM on-board RST button
//
